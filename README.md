# Demos

- [Hello, Spin and Fermyon Cloud](./demos/overview/README.md)

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple path for anyone to run a demo of Spin, Fermyon Cloud, and Spin on Kubernetes (Docker Desktop). This repository is structured with each demo in it's own folder, but should be thought of more as a tree. Anyone new to Spin should begin with the Overview demo or watch the associated recording. The remaining folders represent increasing complicated use cases, many of them building on top of each other.

## Requirements

This repository assumes:

* [Spin is installed](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/install)
* Internet access is available
* An account has been created on [Fermyon Cloud](https://cloud.fermyon.com/)

It's also helpful to have the following:

* A code editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Spin Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fermyon.spin-vscode) installed
* For Kubernetes demo, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [K3d](https://k3d.io/) should be installed.

## Contributing

This repository is owned by Solutions Sales at Fermyon. Contributions are welcome and should include all of the necessary code for the demo to work along with instructions and a talk track in the README.md. A template of this README.md is included in the root folder as README.template.md.
